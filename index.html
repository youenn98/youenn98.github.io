	<h2>Economy</h2>
	<p>My favorite economic wisdom is <q>In the long run, we are all dead.</q> - John Maynard Keynes. </p>
	</br>
	<h2>Computer Science</h2>
	<blockquote><pre>	“people always fear change.people feared electricity when it was invented, didn’t they?people feared coal, they feared gas-powered engines.
	  There will always be ignorance, and ignorance leads to fear.but with time, people will come to accept their silicon masters.” </pre></blockquote>
	<p>Here is my <a title = "check the book list" href = "CS/csbooklist.html">booklist</a>. It will help you,if you didn't major in computer science as an undergraduate.<\br>
	As for me, the most exciting part of computer science is <a href = "CS/csbooklist.html#algorithm">algorithm</a>.
